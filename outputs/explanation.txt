In this project, each Python file creates one specific type of data visualization using Plotly and
NumPy. Every script is independent and running one file directly produces one chart window.
The general flow is always the same:

1. Import necessary libraries: plotly and numpy
2. Set a random seed so that the random numbers are always the same whenever we run the
script.
3. Generate some simple example data
4. Create a Plotly figure object for the selected chart type
5. Call fig.show() to display the interactive chart

The system operates by first selecting a specific script. Once chosen, the script is executed,
which triggers the generation of sample data. This data is then used to construct a Plotly figure,
resulting in the display of the final chart.
