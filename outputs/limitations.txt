The current implementation is functionally effective; however, there is room for improvement
and possible extensions. Currently, the plotting scripts are based on Numpy to generate random
mock data. An extension would be to integrate the Pandas library. This would allow users
to import real-world data directly through a CSV or Excel file. Similarly, modularizing these
scripts as a single Python class or package would improve reusability. That would make it easier
to import the visualizations into other projects. Lastly, the documentation could be improved.
Detailed docstrings and variable definitions to clarify code logic would ensure that the functions
are easily understood by developers.
